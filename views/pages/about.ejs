           Hi Iâ€™m Kapilan Santhiramohan, a software engineer with a passion for coding and developing. Currently a centennial college student for software engineering and aspiring to expand my knowledge on all areas of coding.

            Through obtaining my diploma in software engineering, I will use that as a base to complete a degree in software engineering at an accredited university. My current phase is to gather a base of fundamental knowledge as well as learning how to learn adapt to new programs and languages efficiently. Throughout the three years at centennial college, I have learnt to build programs in many different programming languages such as: C#, Java, UNIX, SQL, ASP.NET, HTML, JavaScript, as well as CSS styling. I have also written up multiple business proposals for project applications that were built for android devices. The documentation consisted of UML diagrams, excel profit and time management charts.
